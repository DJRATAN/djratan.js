Give me a clear Explanatin about circular Linked List.
4 rounds of interview with two online test one technical and one hr with a strict and monitored test process and the candidates were picked with atmost testing the ratio of selection was very low
Explain N queens algorithm? Program for reverse linked list ? Technology used in project?
Reverse linked list Project based questions N queens algorithm SQL queries
We had 2 technical test rounds. First round had 10 mcqs and 3 coding questions which were easy to medium. 2nd technical test round had 10 mcqs and 2 hard coding questions.

How to tell if a number is even or odd without using if else conditions

I wasn't given any specific instructions for the assessment. I had to research another company's product for submission. Then I was accused of plagiarising content when I submitted it. The process could have been smoother.
Interview was okay went through around 4-5 rounds. They asked me to demo system and had very hard questions. It was a lot of process and interview levels and had to allot time and effort for the interview rounds. You have to be confident and have tech background very tediousCan you use the system? Whatâ€™s our edge over competitor
Can you take us through previous tech projects you worked on and what your role was? Take me through your software solutions Implementation experience. How would you prevent customer churn?

2 stages, first stage was quite informal. We talked about my previous internship and my thoughts on day-to-day work life of a PM. It ended with a guesstimate question. 2nd round was more technical based, was asked an RCA question.

Interview Questions

Find the minimum number of characters to add to a given string to make it a palindrome

It was mostly on data structures and algorith based on tree data structure and an sql question which involved group by and rank to find the minimum time required and a general talk with the hr
I was asked about my project specifically and there were strong questions asked about data structures and algorithms. It later ended with regular hr questions like where do you see yourself in the next 5 years.

SQL queries 4-5
Oops concepts Data abstraction, polymorphism
Networking
