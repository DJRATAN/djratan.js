currenty I am doing full time intern as Technical Support along with own studies with compromising learning new things as the same thing I will mangage NSSC role Technical Head without compromising
Yes, we have worked in Smart India Hackathon Aug 2022 as a Volunteer and Technical Head. in this Hackathone We were Leading the all community, participant. we provided best solution for student those was facing any such kind of problem.


In, 1973 NIST or National Institute standared Technology issues a public request for an ecryption algorithm.
Criteria --
		A high level security
		Be easily understood
		Adaptable and economical
		Efficient and exportable

In, 1974 IBM submitted Lucifer. 
Lucifer Encryption Alogrithm 
A block cipher developed by Feistel and his colleagues.
Lucifer was evaluated by National Security Agency who then reduce the key length from 128 bits to 56 bits and changed the inner working.
This then became the Data Encryption Standard or DES and was adopted in 1977 as the government standard for Encrypting data. It's also known as Data Encryption Algorithm or DEA.
The publication of DES prompted a lot of research into cryptography.
DES Algorithm
A minor variation of the Feistel cipher
Encrypts a 64-bit block of data using a 56-bit key
From the 56-bit key, 16 subkeys are generated
Goes through 16 rounds of processing

Security of a Symmetric Cryptosystem.
Depends on two componets:
	The algorithm
	The length of the key
The longer the key, the better the security

Concerns over Attacks
a solution was devised to use three iterations of DES, it called triple DES or 3DES.
Scientists used 3DES.
3DES has an effective key length of 168 bits and block size of 64 bits.
It preserved the exitsting investment in the DES software and the drawback is the algorithm is slow.
Now, 3DES or DES are not considered secure or insecure.

However, they are both still used by some applications.
 
Others symmetric metric block ciphers have been developed.

Blowfish was created by Bruce Schneier and It is Sleek, Simple and fast with a Key that can be up to 448 bits in lenght but typically a 128-bit key is used.

Blowfish is a Feistel algorithm using 64 bit blocks and is free and widely used in applications such as OpenBSD, which is a password hashing alogrithm, and it's actually faster than DES.
Another Alogrithm International Data Encryption Algorith (IDEA)
IDEA was developed to replace DES.
It Operates on 64-bit blocks and uses a 128-bit key.
One of the few ciphers that is patented and actually requires a license for commercial use.

other algorithms include Twofish, CAST5, RC6, and AES(Advanced Encryption Standard), which is now the national standard.

Now, one of the things with symmetric encryption is that there are challenges in that both sender and receiver must use the same shared key and the security must exist in protecting the key, not the algorithm.
Now the challenges include the need to change keys often to avoid the risk of compromising the keys and securety generating and distributing the secret keys.
Symmetric encryption provides fast and efficient encryption, is used for data confidentiality, and is optimized for encrypting large amounts of data.

College Name - > Tyler Junior College

STEP 1: This College Edu gives Github Student Pack without Student ID Card Verification

STEP 2: Use USA IP to Apply to College

STEP 3: College Reply time varies between 24 hours and 72 hours

STEP 4: So You need to be patient and wait for the Edu Email to come

STEP 5:After you receive the confirmation letter from the college then in the confirmation letter you will find something called the A-Number.

STEP 6:Then open the website(https://myapacheaccess.tjc.edu/) in any browser and enter your A-Number in username.

STEP 7:For the password you need to enter TJC followed by MMDDYY.

Here MM = Birth Month DD = Birth Date YY= Last Two Digits of Birth Year

STEP 8: Once you login to the website you will find a opton called ‘Email’ .

STEP 9: Click on that option and then you will be redirected to Gmail where you can see that you have been logged into the Edu Email.

STEP 10: For getting Github go to github.com and click create account.

STEP 11: In the email section enter the edu emails username(find it in gmail tab) followed by @email.tjc.edu.Then put your preferred username and password.

STEP 12: Now go to education.github.com/offers and click ‘I am a student’ and you will find student application page.

STEP 13:You will find Green Tick next to College Name and when you click Continue/Apply.

STEP 14: You will find that Github Student Pack is directly activated and you can easily use all the benefits of the Pack.


## The guide to creating GitHub Student Account to get access to free benefits (worth $200k) without actually being a student:

Requirements:

1.[Nexo Mail](https://nexo.email/)

2.[GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)

3.[Gmail (Spam)](https://mail.google.com/)

4.[Student ID Maker](https://gamitisa.com/cards/studentid/)

5.Desired School Logo in .png format (Refer to step 9)

6.[~~PhotoShop~~ Free PhotoShop](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html)

7.[Strong VPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/)(Only if you are living outside india)

8.[Image of a random **kid** here!](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)

9. Have a school in mind near you and get logo from google.

10.*Skills*

Notices:

1.You will have to cover your webcam to avoid getting your face captured. (Webcam permission is compulsory)

2.You will have to give Location access to GitHub. (Location access compulsory)

3.You will need an existing GitHub account that is having full profile completed.

4.You will need one next mail and one genuine Gmail account.

5.You will always be rejected on the first attempt.

*Recommendation*: Use a secondary browser like firefox which you have never used before

Step1: Go to student id maker and download the ID which you have customized with a kid’s photo. You can keep

any class like 8th,9th,10th,11th, or 12th. Age must be more than 13 years. Keep the school logo that is near you.

Step2: Photoshop it, change the signature, add the kid’s photo, add a bedsheet background behind the ID card and increase the contrast.

Step3: Now export as png and upload to GitHub education form as student ID. Make sure that you select your current school as the one from which you “*borrowed*” the logo.

Step4: Submit the request wait for 1 day and you will get a rejection notice.

Step5: Repeat the process again but add your Gmail also and submit the form with that email. This will make GitHub think you are genuine as you have given an education email and personal email.

Now wait for accept form for 1 or 2 days ( For me it was 6 hours) If it is rejected again then it means you should use VPN as you got IP ban.
